### Exercises

1. Use Lagrange multipliers to optimize $f(x,y) = x^2+3y$ subject to $\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1$.

2. Find the global extrema of the following functions in the corresponding constraints.
	- a) $f(x,y) = (x-2y)^2$, $G := {\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{y^2}{3} = 1}$
	- b) $f(x,y) = (3x+2y)^2$, $G := {4x^2+y^2 = 4}$
