Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique with foundations in linear algebra, particularly eigendecomposition.

**For comprehensive coverage of this topic, see: [[../../../numerical_analysis/Principal Component Analysis]]**

## Linear Algebra Connection

PCA relies on several core linear algebra concepts:

- Covariance matrix calculation and properties
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors for determining principal components
- Orthogonal transformations
- Matrix decomposition (specifically related to SVD)

These concepts provide the mathematical foundation upon which the numerical implementations of PCA are built.
