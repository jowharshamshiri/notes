### Exercises

1. Find the domain of functions $\frac{x-3}{x-2}$, $\frac{x+1}{x^2-3x+2}$, $\sqrt{x-2}$, $\sqrt{|x-2|}$, etc.
2. Analyze piecewise-defined functions, determine if they are monotone and/or bounded.
3. Determine the composition $f_1 \circ f_2$ and $f_2 \circ f_1$, where $f_1(x) = \frac{x-3}{x-2}$ and $f_2(x) = |x-5|$.
4. For a given piecewise function, compute one-sided limits at discontinuity points.
