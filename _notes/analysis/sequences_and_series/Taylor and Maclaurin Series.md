Taylor and Maclaurin series are representations of functions as infinite series that are derived from the function's derivatives at a single point.

## Relationship to Other Series

Taylor series represent an important bridge between:

1. **Power Series**: Taylor series are a special case where coefficients are determined by derivatives
2. **Convergence Theory**: Taylor series have specific convergence properties related to the function's behavior
3. **Function Approximation**: They provide a systematic way to approximate functions with polynomials

The theory of Taylor series illustrates how the behavior of a function at a single point can determine its behavior over a wider domain, connecting local and global properties of functions.

## Series Perspective

From the perspective of series theory, Taylor series demonstrate:

- How infinite series can represent complex functions
- The relationship between convergence radius and function properties
- The importance of remainder estimation in series approximations

This connection illustrates the powerful synthesis between differential calculus and infinite series theory.
