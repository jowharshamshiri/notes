## Mathematical Foundation in Linear Algebra

Principal Component Analysis is fundamentally based on key linear algebra concepts:

1. **Eigendecomposition** of covariance/correlation matrices
2. **Orthogonal transformations** to a new coordinate system
3. **Variance maximization** along principal directions

The operation can be viewed as finding the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, which represent the directions of maximum variance in the data.
