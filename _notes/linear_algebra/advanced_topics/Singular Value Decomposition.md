## Applications in Numerical Analysis

While SVD is fundamentally a linear algebra concept, it has powerful applications in numerical analysis:

1. **Low-Rank Approximations**: Creating compact representations of large matrices
2. **Pseudoinverse Calculation**: Solving ill-conditioned or singular linear systems
3. **Image Compression**: Reducing storage requirements while preserving key information
4. **Noise Reduction**: Filtering out components with small singular values
5. **Computational Methods**: Numerical stability in various matrix computations

The numerical implementation of SVD uses algorithms such as the Golub-Reinsch method or the Jacobi method, which balance computational efficiency with numerical stability.
