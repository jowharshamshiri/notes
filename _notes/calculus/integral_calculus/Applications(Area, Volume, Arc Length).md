# Geometric Applications of Integration

This file covers the use of integration to compute geometric quantities such as areas, volumes, and arc lengths.

## See

- [[Integration Techniques]] - For methods of computing these integrals
- [[Multiple Integrals]] - For higher-dimensional geometric applications
- [[Vector Calculus]] - For related concepts in vector fields

### Exercises

1. Evaluate the area $A = \int_{3}^{4} \frac{x-3}{x^2-4} dx$ using integration techniques.
