### Exercises

1. Apply the chain rule to compute derivatives like $\frac{d}{dx}[f(3x)]^2$, $\frac{d}{dx}\tan[f(x)]^2$.
2. Compute $g'(1)$ taking into account that $f(1) = 1$ and $f'(1) = 3$ for functions like $g(x) = x^2 + f(x)$, $g(x) = x^2f(x)$.
3. Compute the following derivatives.
	1. a) $\frac{d}{dx}[2f(3f(x))]$
	2. b) $\frac{d}{dx}[e^{[f(x)]^{2+5}}]$
